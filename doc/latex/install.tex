\chapter{Installing ITR}
\label{ch:install}

ITR is implemented in C++ and exported as a module to R using Rcpp. This chapter
describes the steps to install ITR both as a standalone C++ library and a R
package. 

\section{As a C++ library}
\label{sec:c}
To build ITR as a standalone C++ library, user needs to have {\tt cmake} version
3.12 or later installed. Assume that the code has been unpacked in {\tt
  /path/to/ITR}, and will be built in {\tt /path/to/build} and installed to
{\tt /path/to/install}, execute the following steps

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=]
  > cd /path/to/build
  > cmake /path/to/ITR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
  > make
  > make install
\end{lstlisting}

This will install header files to {\tt /path/to/install/include/itr} and
static library {\tt libitr.a} to {\tt /path/to/install/lib}. The package
has been tested with {\tt gcc} version 8.1.0 or later, and LLVM 9.1.0 or later.
User could specify which compiler to use by prefixing
{\tt CC=/path/to/c\_compiler CXX=/path/to/cpp\_compiler} to the
{\tt cmake} configuration line.

\section{As a R module}
To install ITR as a R module, user issues 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=]
  > R CMD INSTALL /path/to/ITR
\end{lstlisting}

This will install the package for all users on the computer. If the
user does not have root access or wishes to install the package locally at
{\tt /path/to/local/R/library}, it can be achieved by running 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=]
  > R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/local/R/library /path/to/ITR
\end{lstlisting}

If the library is installed locally, one needs to load the package by
specifying the {\tt lib.loc} option: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, frame=]
  library('ITR', lib.loc='/path/to/local/R/library')
\end{lstlisting}

The package requires C++14, so one may encounter an error during the
installation 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=]
Error in .shlib_internal(args) : 
  C++14 standard requested but CXX14 is not defined
\end{lstlisting}

If that is the case, create a personal {\tt $\sim$/.R/Makevars} file with
the following lines
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=]
CXX14 = g++ # or the full path to your C++14 compliant compiler
CXXFLAGS = -O2 -g $(LTO)
CXXPICFLAGS = -fPIC
CXX14STD = -std=c++14
\end{lstlisting}
