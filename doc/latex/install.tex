\chapter{Installation}

The package is implemented in C++ and can be built with {\tt cmake}
version 3.12 or later. The package has been tested with {\tt gcc}
version 8.1.0 and {\tt clang} version 9.1.0. 

Assume that the source code has been unpacked into directory
{\tt /path/to/ITR}, the following steps will build the library in
{\tt /path/to/ITR-build} and install the library in
{\tt /path/to/ITR-install}. 

\begin{verbatim}
> cd /path/to/ITR-build
> cmake /path/to/ITR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/ITR-install
> make 
\end{verbatim}

The user is welcome to specify a particular compiler by prefixing
{\tt CC=/path/to/c\_compiler CXX=/path/to/cpp\_compiler} to the
{\tt cmake} configuration line. 

The package uses {\tt googletest} for unit testing, which is
downloaded automatically during the configuration phase. The user is
recommended to verify the build before the final installation, and
this can be done as follows

\begin{verbatim}
> cd /path/to/ITR-build/test
> make test
> ./test
\end{verbatim}

Once the build is verified, one can complete the installation
\begin{verbatim}
> cd /path/to/ITR-build
> make install
\end{verbatim}

This will install header file {\tt ITR.h} to
{\tt /path/to/ITR-install/include/itr} and
{\tt libitr.a} to {\tt path/to/ITR-install/lib}.
